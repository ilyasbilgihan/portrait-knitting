# Portrait Knitting

Knit a portrait of someone.

## Settings Panel

We have 5 settings and 1 source image url input boxes.

#### The Settings are:

- **Max Line Count** - How many vectors (straight lines) will be in our knitted thread.
- **Pin Count** - How many pins does the circular path have.
- **Min Distance(n)** - There will be no vectors (straight lines) from **i<sup>th</sup>** pin to **(i+1,2,3,...,n-1)<sup>th</sup>** pin.
- **Color Reduce Amount(percent)** - For every line we draw, we will decrease the darkness of the line's pixels from the source image
